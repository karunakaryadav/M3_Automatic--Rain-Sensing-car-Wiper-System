# MODEL:
    We have implemented a model that senses rains and automatically switches on the wiper and adjusts its speed according to the intensity of the rain. As the intensity of the rain increases, the speed of the wiper increases to a certain level. According to our observations, the wiper takes 2.2 seconds when a drop of water falls on the sensor, while it takes only 1.4 seconds when the sensor is submerged in a glass of water. We learned how to interface servo motor with AT89C51 Microcontroller and also the rain sensor module interfacing with AT89C51 Microcontroller.Further modifications in the circuit will lead to controlling the speed of the wiper to a more accurate sense. Currently the wiper moves at two different speeds. By modifying the code we can have different speed for different amount of rain. Also we can use this automated car wiper along with other automated features to make a Smart Car.
